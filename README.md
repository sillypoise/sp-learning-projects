# sillypoise learning projects

A monorepo containing a series of webdev projects completed for learning purposes.

I store it all in a monorepo because I don't like having a million repos.

Feel free to clone, explore and contribute.

Most projects are from tutorial series that allow me to explore different tech stacks, frameworks and libraries!

Have fun, break stuff and learn
